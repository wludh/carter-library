# Carter Library Project README	

This repo contains project materials for the Thomas Henry Carter Library. Carter was a Washington and Lee University student in the 1950s whose correspondence with Ezra Pound contributed to the early development of the literary magazine *Shenandoah*. In 2015, Leyburn Library acquired Carter's personal papers and library from Patrick Henry Community College.  

This collection, in addition to providing insight into the history of *Shenandoah*, also presents a snapshot of the personal library of a young, Southern literary scholar. From this collection of books, pamphlets, and zines, we hope to learn more about the collector as well as the literary scene in the mid-20th century (Carter died in 1963). Since this is a collection of bibliographic data, we hope to use this project as a vehicle to explore linked data possibilities. As librarians, we understand the challenges in organizing, preserving, and providing access to a distinct personal library within the context of a larger library and special collections. Personal libraries are just that - personal, requiring a measured application of cataloging procedures. 



## Research Agenda
- Inventory the collection
    - What does the collection say about Carter? about academia in his time? about his W&L education?
    - What outliers/surprises exist?
    - Who/what is missing from the collection?
- Create a virtual browsing environment
    - evaluate the potential of Project Blacklight and other platforms for use
    - highlight marginalia, clippings, and other “ephemeral” aspects of the collection
    - expose connections between items - the obvious and not obvious
- Explore linked data possibilities
    - what is the MARC > BIBFRAME experience?
    - how can it benefit/enhance research?
    - how can it link back to the rest of the [Literary Networks](http://www.literarynetworks.org) project?
